Project: Shall we continue? Project name PromptUser



Algorithm:

Ask the user “Would you like to continue?”. 
Get the user response. 
Check the user response for 3 things:
          - if he answers yes “Y” then continue, re-prompt the user
          - if he answers no “N” then quit
          - for all other responses display the error message and then re-prompt the user



Pseudocode:

Declare variables
Create a scanner
do
        Prompt the user “Would you like to continue?”
	Get the response
	if response equals ignore case to “y”
		continue
	else if response equals ignore case to “n”
		Display “Quit”
	else 
		Print "Error"
		Get the response
while response equals ignore case “y”
End Do While
End program
